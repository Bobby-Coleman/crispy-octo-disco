Let me help you update the background music file. First, I'll check the current audio directory structure.

I see that there are two boss music files - one in WAV format and one in MP3 format. Since you mentioned you've updated the WAV file, I'll help you update the code to use the new WAV file. Let me search for where this audio file is referenced in the code.

I found that the audio file is referenced in `js/main.js`. Let me read that file to see the context and make the necessary changes.


---

Read file: js/main.js

---

I'll update the code to use the new WAV file instead of the MP3 file.


---

```diff
      
      // Start background music
-     const bgMusic = new Audio('audio/boss.mp3');
+     const bgMusic = new Audio('audio/boss.wav');
      bgMusic.loop = true;
      bgMusic.volume = 0.5; // Set to 50% volume
```

---

I've updated the code to use the new WAV file instead of the MP3 file. The changes include:
1. Changed the audio file path from `audio/boss.mp3` to `audio/boss.wav`
2. Kept all other audio settings the same (looping, volume, and error handling)

The game should now play your updated WAV file as the background music. The music will still loop continuously and play at 50% volume. Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you deploy your game to Heroku. First, we need to make sure we have the necessary Heroku configuration files. Let me check what files we currently have.

I see we have a `server.js` and `package.json`, which is good. Let me check their contents to ensure they're properly configured for Heroku deployment.


---

Read file: server.js

---

Read file: package.json

Great! The configuration looks good. Now, let's deploy to Heroku. I'll help you with the steps:

1. First, let's make sure all changes are committed to git:
